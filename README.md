# 🧩 Day 01 – C++ Basics

First day of the C++ course — practiced three basic exercises to get familiar with input/output, ASCII conversion, and conditional statements.

---

### 1️⃣ ASCII Conversion

Convert between a character and its ASCII value.

* Input a character and display its ASCII code.
* Input a number and display the corresponding character.

---

### 2️⃣ Simple Calculator

A basic calculator that takes two numbers and an operation (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) and prints the result.

---

### 3️⃣ Character Case Conversion

Convert a character from uppercase to lowercase or the opposite using ASCII arithmetic.

---

### 💡 Concepts Used

* Input/output (`cin`, `cout`)
* Type casting (`char` ↔ `int`)
* Conditional statements (`if`, `else if`)
* Basic arithmetic operations
